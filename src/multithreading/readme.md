    - Exception handling with `exceptionally()` and `handle()`.

## **12. Locks and Locking Mechanisms**
- **Lock Interface**
    - `ReentrantLock` and `ReentrantReadWriteLock`.
    - How `Lock` is different from synchronized blocks.
    - Features of `ReentrantLock` like fairness, interruptibility, etc.

- **StampedLock**
    - Advanced locking mechanism with support for optimistic reads.
    - Use cases and performance benefits.

## **13. Advanced Synchronizers**
- **CyclicBarrier**
    - How it synchronizes a set of threads that must all arrive at a common barrier point.
- **CountDownLatch**
    - Allows one or more threads to wait for a set of events to occur.
    - Example: Wait for all threads to finish before proceeding.
- **Semaphore**
    - Counting semaphore for controlling access to a shared resource.
    - Difference between binary and counting semaphores.
- **Exchanger**
    - Used to exchange objects between two threads at a synchronization point.
- **Phaser**
    - A more flexible version of `CyclicBarrier` and `CountDownLatch`.

- **Using `ThreadLocal` for Thread-Specific Data**
    - Thread-local storage for variables.
    - Benefits and drawbacks of `ThreadLocal` variables.
- **InheritableThreadLocal**
    - How it differs from `ThreadLocal` (allows child threads to inherit the value).
