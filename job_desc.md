To prepare for this Java developer role in one month, given your experience in Java but limited exposure to AWS, a structured plan focusing on skill enhancement in specific areas will be most effective. Below is a week-by-week breakdown to guide you toward meeting the job requirements and building confidence for the responsibilities listed.

---

### **Week 1: Core Java Refresher and OOP Principles**
Focus: Reinforce Java fundamentals and design patterns.

1. **Java Ecosystem and OOP:**
    - Review object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction in Java.
    - Deepen understanding of Java’s collection framework, lambda expressions, and the Stream API.
    - Review concurrency in Java (e.g., threads, Executors, and ForkJoinPool) and basic multithreading concepts.

2. **Design Patterns & Architectural Patterns:**
    - Study commonly used design patterns in Java such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Decorator.
    - Familiarize yourself with architectural patterns like MVC and Microservices, as these are often used in scalable applications.

3. **Reusable Java Libraries:**
    - Practice writing simple, reusable code snippets and libraries.
    - Work on writing clean, readable code, and establish consistent naming conventions and documentation practices.

4. **Hands-On Practice:**
    - Develop small projects or use case implementations to apply these principles and patterns.
    - Use a platform like **LeetCode** or **HackerRank** for coding exercises focusing on algorithms and data structures in Java.

---

### **Week 2: Spring Boot and Backend Service Development**
Focus: Gain a solid understanding of Spring Boot, a vital framework for modern Java applications.

1. **Spring Boot Basics:**
    - Set up a basic Spring Boot project to understand the structure, configurations, and annotations.
    - Study dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC) as key features in Spring applications.

2. **Developing RESTful APIs:**
    - Implement basic REST APIs using Spring Boot, covering GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
    - Understand how to create controllers, services, and repositories for an MVC-style project.

3. **Data Persistence with JPA/Hibernate:**
    - Integrate Java Persistence API (JPA) with Spring Boot and set up a basic relational database.
    - Learn basic CRUD operations, entity mapping, and relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one).

4. **Spring Boot Testing:**
    - Explore automated testing in Spring Boot using JUnit and Mockito.
    - Focus on writing unit tests for service and repository layers.

5. **Hands-On Practice:**
    - Build a small CRUD application using Spring Boot to practice these concepts.

---

### **Week 3: AWS Fundamentals and Cloud Integration**
Focus: Understand the basics of cloud computing and AWS services relevant to Java applications.

1. **AWS Basics:**
    - Review core AWS services relevant to backend development, such as EC2 (virtual servers), S3 (storage), and IAM (identity and access management).
    - Sign up for the AWS Free Tier and explore these services practically.

2. **AWS Lambda and Serverless Functions:**
    - Understand AWS Lambda basics and how to create and trigger Lambda functions.
    - Learn how to invoke Lambda functions from a Spring Boot application.

3. **AWS CloudWatch and Monitoring:**
    - Familiarize yourself with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring logs and performance metrics.
    - Set up basic CloudWatch alarms and understand log monitoring for your Lambda functions or EC2 instances.

4. **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service):**
    - Understand the role of SQS in managing asynchronous messages between microservices.
    - Practice implementing a simple message queue and integrate it with a Spring Boot application.

5. **Hands-On Practice:**

### **Week 4: Building, Testing, and Version Control**
Focus: Finalize your preparation by covering build tools, testing strategies, and version control best practices.

1. **Build Tools: Maven, Gradle, Ant:**
    - Get hands-on with Maven and Gradle to understand how they work in dependency management, builds, and deployments.
    - Set up a basic build pipeline using Maven or Gradle for your Spring Boot project.

    - Practice Git workflows used in team environments (e.g., feature branching, pull requests, code reviews).

4. **HTML/CSS & Thymeleaf (Optional):**
    - If time allows, review Thymeleaf templates and basic HTML/CSS to integrate front-end components with your Spring Boot application.
