Sure! Here's a breakdown of each of the topics related to multithreading in Java, along with explanations, examples, and code snippets. Let's go step by step.

### 1. **Introduction to Multithreading**
Multithreading is a feature of Java that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum CPU utilization. Each part of the program is called a **thread**, and threads run in parallel.

**Benefits of Multithreading**:
- **Efficient CPU Utilization**: By dividing the tasks into multiple threads, CPU can switch between them, making better use of system resources.
- **Improved Performance**: Threads allow performing background tasks without affecting the main logic.
- **Simpler Code**: By using threads, tasks like I/O operations or network communication can be handled more effectively.

### 2. **Extending the Thread Class**

To create a thread in Java, one way is to extend the `Thread` class and override its `run()` method.

#### Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Starts the execution of the thread, which internally calls the run() method.
    }
}
```
- **start()**: This method starts a new thread of execution.
- **run()**: Contains the code that is executed by the thread when it is started.

### 3. **Implementing Runnable and Callable Interfaces**

#### a) **Runnable Interface**
Instead of extending the `Thread` class, you can implement the `Runnable` interface. This is useful when your class already extends another class (since Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance).

#### Example:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running using Runnable...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

#### b) **Callable Interface**
`Callable` is similar to `Runnable` but it can return a result and throw a checked exception.

#### Example using Callable:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.FutureTask;

class MyCallable implements Callable<Integer> {
    public Integer call() throws Exception {
        return 10 + 20;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        MyCallable callable = new MyCallable();
        FutureTask<Integer> futureTask = new FutureTask<>(callable);
        Thread t1 = new Thread(futureTask);
        t1.start();
        System.out.println(futureTask.get());  // This will print 30
    }
}
```
- **Callable** allows a thread to return a result.
- **FutureTask** is used to manage the result of the callable task.

### 4. **Daemon Thread vs Non-Daemon Thread**

- **Daemon Thread**: These are low-priority threads that run in the background, e.g., garbage collection.
- **Non-Daemon Thread**: These are the main application threads.

To make a thread daemon, call `setDaemon(true)` before starting the thread.

#### Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        if (Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()) {
            System.out.println("Daemon thread is running");
        } else {
            System.out.println("User thread is running");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t1.setDaemon(true);  // Set t1 as daemon
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### 5. **Inter-Thread Communication**

In Java, threads can communicate with each other using methods like:
- **wait()**: A thread that calls `wait()` goes into the waiting state.
- **notify()**: Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.
- **notifyAll()**: Wakes up all threads waiting on the object's monitor.

#### Example:
```java
class InterThreadComm {
    synchronized void produce() throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Producing...");
        wait();
        System.out.println("Resumed");
    }

    synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        System.out.println("Consuming...");
        notify();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        InterThreadComm comm = new InterThreadComm();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                comm.produce();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
        });
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                comm.consume();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
        });
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
Here, `produce()` waits and `consume()` notifies.

### 6. **Thread Methods (sleep, join, yield, etc.)**

- **sleep(time)**: Pauses the thread for the specified time.
- **join()**: Waits for the thread to die.
- **yield()**: Pauses the currently executing thread to give a chance for other threads of the same priority to execute.

#### Example of sleep and join:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);  // Sleep for 1 second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
        t1.join();  // Main thread waits for t1 to finish
        System.out.println("Thread has finished execution");
    }
}
```

### 7. **Synchronization: What and Why?**

When multiple threads try to access shared resources (e.g., a variable or object), **race conditions** can occur. **Synchronization** ensures that only one thread accesses the resource at a time.

- **Synchronized Methods**: Synchronizes the entire method.
- **Synchronized Blocks**: Synchronizes a specific block of code inside a method.
- **Static Synchronization**: Locks the class-level monitor, ensuring that only one thread can access static synchronized methods.

### 8. **Synchronized Method**

In Java, methods can be synchronized using the `synchronized` keyword to prevent thread interference.

#### Example:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());  // Should be 2000
    }
}
```
Here, the `increment` method is synchronized, ensuring thread safety.

### 9. **Synchronized Block**

Instead of synchronizing the entire method, you can synchronize only part of the method.

#### Example:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {  // Synchronize only this block
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### 10. **Static Synchronization**

Static synchronization synchronizes at the class level rather than the instance level.

#### Example:
```java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    public static synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
In this case, only one thread can access the `increment` method for all instances of the `Counter` class.
